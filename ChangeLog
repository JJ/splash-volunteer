	* index.js (App): Avoid getting the same chromosome over and over
	again and carried over from one run to the next.

	that uses leroux-cache, already installed.

	* run-no-restart-server.sh: It takes *longer* to run if the server
	is not restarted. Probably due to the takeover effect 

	time ./run-no-restart-server.sh > 50runs-norestart.dat
./run-no-restart-server.sh > 50runs-norestart.dat  1899,95s user 8,02s system 100% cpu 31:44,56 total


	* run.sh: First run n

	➜  splash-volunteer git:(master) ✗ time ./run.sh > 50runs.dat 
./run.sh > 50runs.dat  1577,83s user 9,21s system 101% cpu 25:56,56 total

	Now running without restarting.

	* index.js (App): IRC does not work because it sends too many
	messages. Bails out with "Excess flood". Besides, only the
	simplest information is sent.
